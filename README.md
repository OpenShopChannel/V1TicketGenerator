# V1TicketGenerator

A tool to create v1 Tickets found on the Nintendo Wii.

## Usage
This tool was created purely for use in [WiiSOAP](https://github.com/OpenShopChannel/WiiSOAP), 
as service tickets use this special file format. For the purposes of WiiSOAP, this tool is complete,
but according to esitypes.h there are more structures that exist.

Check the `ticket_test.go` file for usage example.
